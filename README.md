# The aim of the project is to classify diabetes according to certain variables
During the study, we found the following patterns:
1. The older a person is, the higher the risk of developing diabetes.
2. The HBA1C_ level increases the risk of developing diabetes after a value of 6.
# Conclusion
We found that random forest and decision tree showed the best accuracy and the difference between them is minimal. To continue the development of this topic, I suggest collecting more data and increasing the number of features.
